# Convert-text-to-code.
Converts text to code for C C++.
This is C-strings and Cpp-syntax combined.
It has things needed to combine C and C++ in on file.
It has been used to test new functions and features for the others.
## To use
The .cpp files must be compiled as a C++ file.  Python must be installed to use the .py file.
Its best used in a terminal emulator that splits screen.
Run the program on one side. Copy and paste to the other side.    
I will not be accepting pull requests for this.
