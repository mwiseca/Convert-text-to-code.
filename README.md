# Convert-text-to-code.
Converts text to code snippets for C C++.
This is C-strings and Cpp-syntax combined.
It has things needed to combine C and C++ in on file.
It has been used to test new functions and features for the others.<br>
It has what's needed to complete simple programs.<br>
This is best used for learning C C++ syntax, not to enhance productivity.
## To use
The .cpp files must be compiled as a C++ file.<br>
The .c file must be compiled as a C file.<br>
Python must be installed to use the .py file.<br>
Its best used in a terminal emulator that splits screen.<br>
Run the program on one side. Copy and paste completed code to the other side.
