# Convert-text-to-code.
Converts text to code for C C++.
This is C-strings and Cpp-syntax combined.
It has things needed to combine C and C++ in on file.
It has been used to test new functions and features for the others.
This is more suitable for people teaching than new learners as there are many choices
to memorize.
## To use
The .cpp files must be compiled as a C++ file.
Its best used in a terminal emulator that splits screen.
Run the program on one side. Copy and paste to the other side.  Finished code must be copied and pasted to the program.  
I will not be accepting pull requests for this.
